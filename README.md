# Test_Automation_Skills

Hi, I'm Nicola Lombardi, a Software Engineer with a strong background in Python development, automation, and DevOps, particularly in the telecommunications sector. Over the past few years, I have worked extensively on M2M communication technologies, focusing on both software testing and network infrastructure. My expertise lies in leveraging Python for automation tasks, including writing test cases, implementing test plans, and resolving bugs, all while following Agile methodologies such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Scrum.

These simple project are only a part of my Skill. In general, I followed both Software  and Hardware M2M project, but Data Analysis is a plus.

My approach published  in ResearchGate:
1 - choice of an application of interest and therefore of a frequency mask on which to size the component to be simulated 
2 - theoretical design of an antenna and monitoring of the construction parameters 
3 - design on CAD (CST), setup of the mesh-grid and Postprocessing of the simulation results 
4 - data interpretation 
5 - Sweep parameters until obtaining the project specifications 
6- export of the datasets (.txt, .json, .csv, .xlsx) 
7 - data analysis (Python language with its libraries pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn) and therefore have the sequence of operations on the dataframe: 
7.1 -- preprocessing 
7.2 --postprocessing 
7.3 --sensitivity analysis with Machine Learning (split, training and testing) to allow a broader view of the possible scenarios
